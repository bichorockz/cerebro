# Cerebro

At the end of this lab you will be able to create a Slack Chatbot service which makes use of [Watson Conversation Services (WCS)](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/conversation/) to direct user interaction.  In addition, you'll be able to add configurable services for connecting to Twillio for text/sms capabilities, and also the ability to connect to IBM's Event Central tool for viewing and enrolling-in events.
