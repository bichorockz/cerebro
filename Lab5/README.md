# Lab 5 - Create Event Central capabilities
In this section you will learn how to connect your bot to the Event Central web api so that you can retrieve content to display to your user.

This section is only relevant to current IBM Employees.  If you are not a current IBM Employee then 
you will not be able to complete these steps as they require access to content only available to IBM 
Employees.

Connecting our bot to IBM's Event Central platform allows us to extract information from an event and display it to the user, with the optional functionality of allowing them to enroll.  If you do not wish to use this functionality then you may skip this section.

1. Navigate your browser to W3.

2. Search on Event Central

3. Navigate to the Event Central page, then click on the appropriate button to either create a new event or to find an existing event.

4.  We need an event ID for this project functionality, so follow the Event Central website to create a new event and capture it's ID, or navigate to an existing event and capture the ID from it's page.


**That's it, you're all done!**
